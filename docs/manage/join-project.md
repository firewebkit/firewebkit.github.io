# Join Project
To join an existing firewebkit project, you need to have "project secret key". Once you have that, it is a simple few step process.

> Admins can view the project secret key on Members tab (under current members list) on [security](https://console.firewebkit.com/security#members) page.

#### 1. Log in to Firewebkit

#### 2. Go to [projects](https://console.firewebkit.com/projects)

#### 5. Click "Join"
Clicking on join button will make you "editor" of the project. You will need to ask someone with higher role to assign you permissions or change your role.

> You might want to read about various [roles](/docs/security/roles.md) and [permissions](/docs/security/permissions.md) for firewebkit users.
